# Prediction-of-Sudden-Cardiac-Death-Using-Logistic-Regression

Welcome to our Sudden-Cardiac-Death prediction project.

1.) To run the program, you will need to download python on your system and download skelarn libraries.

About Our Project:

  After processing the signal file obtained from the electrodes placed on out test subject using LabView, we did signal processing using MathLab and extracting 
  
  the various features of the ECG signal. The signal was ectracted to a csv file, which was used for testing on our model. The dataset used for developing the 
  
  model was taken from Physionet website, where various Classification models was tested and Classification and Rgression model was found to have the best accuracy.
  
  We created a UI interface using python-Tkinter library, where any user can input data into the model and get the predicted class on which our model was trained on.
